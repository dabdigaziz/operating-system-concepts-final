In this file will write how we doing connection type for internet 

First method Direct IP connection: 
First of all we should install network-manager in terminal. That's why we should write:
sudo apt-get install network-manager
#end of this code 

after this we should add DHCP connection to enp0s3, then we should check by pinging services.
For this we should write this one:
sudo apt-get install dhcpcd5
ip link show
sudo dhcpcd enp0s3
ping google.com -c3
#end of this code

by this code we download dhcpcd5 for adding dhcp. after this we added connection dhcp by enp0s3.
After all this manipulation we are checking the connection by "ping" code. Because of this, we can identify that dhcp successfully added.

Second method connection via NAT:
We connect ip forwarding so that Linux can function as well as an imaginary computer. After this we should configure iptables NAT by basing 2 iptables priciples.
At the end we should control of iptables NAT as well as their support.
For this manipulations we should write in termninal:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A forward -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
iptables -vnL -t nat
#end of this code in terminal

By this code we connect ip forwarding so that Linux can function as well as an imaginary computer. After this we should configure iptables NAT by basing 2 iptables priciples.
At the end we should control of iptables NAT as well as their support.
