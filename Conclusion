Our final project for OSC required hard work as we needed to develop skills that are 
crucial for our future as cybersecurity specialists or system administrators. These skills included 
adding new users to the OS, establishing Internet connections using various methods, and 
building a Linux OS kernel using kernel modules. The creation of the Linux kernel module gave 
us a deeper understanding of the Linux kernel and its operations, allowing us to create unique 
drivers, expand the capabilities of the kernel and understand how the kernel and hardware 
interact. In general, these events taught us the various elements necessary for the administration 
of a Linux system. Each stage, from user management to Internet connection, requires a certain 
level of knowledge and understanding of the underlying systems and protocols. Thanks to this 
experience, we have learned valuable lessons and have a better understanding of how these 
concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.
In addition to the technical skills we acquired, this project also helped us develop 
important soft skills such as teamwork, time management and communication. Collaboration 
with our colleagues and knowledge sharing were crucial to the success of the project, and we 
learned how to balance our workload and effectively meet deadlines. We also honed our 
communication skills by presenting our work and ideas to our classmates and teachers.
In addition, this project allowed us to look into the rapidly developing world of 
cybersecurity and understand the importance of ensuring the security of systems. We realized the 
importance of vigilance and a proactive approach to ensuring the security of systems and 
protecting confidential information from cyber threats.
Overall, our final project for OSC was a valuable learning experience that prepared us for 
future challenges in cybersecurity and system administration. This not only provided us with 
technical skills, but also helped us develop important soft skills and a broader understanding of 
the importance of system security.
