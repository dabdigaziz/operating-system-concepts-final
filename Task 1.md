First of all we are opening virtual box and entering to the ubuntu.
In the Desktop we are opening terminal and entering this codes:
sudo adduser student
New password: student
Re-type new password: student
#Adding additional information:
Full name: Student
Room number: Student
Work Phone: Student
Home Phone: Student
Other: Student
#Giving the root permissions 
sudo usermod -aG sudo student
#End of this code

We should log out from current user and login as student.
When we are choosing the user we should write password(student).
After login we should open terminal and write this:
input: whoami
output: student

input: uname -r
output: 5.4.0-67-generic

input: uname
output: Linux

#End of this code

Because of this manipulation we can identify that we created a new user and gave the root permissions in the Linux OS.
